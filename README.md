# Nand-to-Tetris
This is a collection of exercises I have done following the Nand to Tetris book
The first 6 chapter treat the hardware side of a PC, while the other half addresses the software side.
Highly recomended book. 

Chapters:
01-Boolean Logic;  
02-Boolean Arithmetic;  
03-Sequential Logic;  
04-Machine Language;  
05-Computer Architecture;  
06-Assembler;  
07-Virtual Machine I: Stack Arithmetic;  
08-Virtual Machine II: Program Control;  
09-High-Level Language;  
10-Compiler I: Syntax Analysis;  
11-Compiler II: Code Generation;  
12-Operating System;  

The book focuses on using HDL (Hardware Descriptive Language), which is a custom-made and simplified version of VHDL. It also uses the Jax programming language for educational porpuses.
I decided to add a personal touch by trying the same exercises with X86 assembly code and C.
